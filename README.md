# mealchooser


This side project is created with Node.js, React, Express, and MySQL. What it does is we can input the place that we just got food (including the date), and with using a scoring metric, it outputs the name of the restaurant it recommends to go in 2 situations 
          1) you love the food that you are eating these days
          2)you are so bored and want to eat something you haven't had for so long
In addition, it also shows the dates of the last three meals we just had at each restaurant.

Note that: it only runs locally, so if you want to test it, you have to download all the code and the database
